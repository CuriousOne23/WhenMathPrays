**Love = ∑ [max(vis,0) × max(resonance,0) × fidelity × altruism × (|M1 ∪ M2| - |M1|) × avg(γ_self(t), tw) × exp(-ΔS t)]**

**γ_self(t) = -ego_flux(t) + i · bond_flux(t)** 

Love and gamma_self space is 2 dimensional:
1. +Re-> +infinity, total surrender, no eqo, 0 +/- pi/4 degrees
2. -Re-> -infinity, total ego, only you exist, -pi +/- pi/4 degrees
3. +Im-> +infinity, total bonding, your existence is defined by union with other, +pi/2 +/- pi/4
4. -Im-> -Infinity, total enmity, hatred, avoidance at all costs, -pi/2 +/- pi/4
5. Stable Region angle is +pi/2 +/- pi/4
6. |love| = strength of feeling or desire within the defined region of space #1 thru #5
7. |gamma_self| =  = strength of feeling or desire within the defined region of space #1 thru #5
8. avg(gamma_self(t), tw) defines avgerage vector of space operation over a window of average, tw
9. ΔS >= 0, the other terms in love must overcome entropy for their to be love
