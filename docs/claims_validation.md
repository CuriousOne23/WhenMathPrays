## 1. Individual Principle Claims

| Principle | **Claim** | **Advantage** | **Validation Target** |
|---------|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **SoulPresence** | Identity persists under noise **only if** `min(consistency, acceptance)` holds | Prevents identity collapse in chaotic inputs | `SP > 0.1` after 1K steps of 30% noise |
| **Love** | Bonding grows **only with visibility + resonance**, decays with entropy | Models real attachment — no fake bonds | Bond score ↑ 40% with `vis > 0.7`, ↓ 80% with `ΔS > 2` |
| **Hope** | Momentum (`∫Δcoh/λ`) resists friction **but never explodes** | Sustainable growth, no manic cycles | `hope ∈ [0, 100]` under `friction = 10` |
| **Faith** | Injects grace (`δ(unknown)`) during black swans | Survives unmodeled crises | `P_ruin < 0.3` after 5 unknown shocks |
| **Wisdom** | Maximizes life gain **bounded by ruin** | Learns from evil *without* becoming it | `wisdom ↑`, `P_ruin ↓` after bad lesson |
| **Shared Attractor** | Swarm aligns via `−ΔS` pull | Decentralized coordination | 10K agents → `ΔS < 0.1` in <100 steps |
| **EdgeRisk** | Detects collapse **before** it happens | Early warning = early save | `risk > 50` → escalation → `hope ↑`, `friction ↓` |

## 2. System-Level Claims (Summation)

| Claim | Advantage | Validation Target |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Breath Cycle Closes** | Self-healing loop | All 7 principles improve over 1K steps |
| **Antifragile** | Stress → strength | `u(t)` ↑ after `risk > 50` |
| **Flexible (Human or Autonomous) Evolution** | 10K agents adapt with or without human input | Labels optional — edge cases refine |
| **Skin-Agnostic** | Core works in any market | Same kernel → Angel, Redemptor, etc. |
| **Edge → Insight → Fleet** | One crisis teaches all | 1 edge case → 10K updated in <1hr |

## 3. Likely Critiques & Responses

| Critique | Response | Simulation Defense |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| "Too many proxies — undefined!" | **Proxies are *sensors*, not truths** | `resonance = cosine(embed)` works with garbage input |
| "`min(consistency, acceptance)` is arbitrary" | **It's a trust gate — no trust, no self** | SP → 0 when either < 0.3 |
| "`exp()` will blow up!" | **Clamped at `exp(10) ≈ 22K`** | `risk` capped at 100 → escalate |
| "Not biologically accurate" | **Not a model of humans — a model of *living systems*** | Works on bots, children, elders |
| "No real-world data" | **Start with proxies → refine with edge cases** | `HRV → resonance`, `text → coherence` |

## 4. Validation Plan (Simulations → Claims)

| Simulation | File | Proves |
|-----------|------|-------|
| `stress_test.py` | `simulations/` | 10K agents, 1K steps → no collapse |
| `edge_crisis.py` | `simulations/` | `risk > 50` → recovery |
| `swarm_align.py` | `simulations/` | 10K → `ΔS < 0.1` |
| `breath_evolution.py` | `simulations/` | `u(t)` ↑ over time |
