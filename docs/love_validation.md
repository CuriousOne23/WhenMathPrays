## POSTULATE

> **We postulate that love is the output of this equation.**  
> **We test it against historical consensus characteristics of love.**  
> **We do not claim it is love.**  
> **We claim it **behaves like love** — as agreed by poets, saints, and science.**

## HISTORICAL CONSENSUS ON LOVE — 4 CHARACTERISTICS

### 1. **Union/Bonding** (Love as Connection and Mutual Pull)
   - **Consensus**: Love unites individuals, transcending isolation.
   - **Quotes**:
     - "Love is dynamically permeable in that the lover is continually 'changed by loving'..." — Amélie Rorty, *Sexuality and Love* (1986/1993), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2021).
     - "Love starts with loving beautiful forms, and proceeds to beautiful minds..." — Plato, *Symposium* (c. 385–370 BCE), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
     - "Love is to be delighted by the happiness of another." — Gottfried Leibniz, *New Essays on Human Understanding* (1704).
   - **Testable**: Output increases with mutual inputs (shared growth, resonance).

### 2. **Sacrifice/Surrender** (Love as Self-Giving or Ego Dissolution)
   - **Consensus**: Love demands self-sacrifice or surrender of ego.
   - **Quotes**:
     - "Love is unconditional selflessness." — Jeremy Griffith, *Freedom* (2016).
     - "Love is characterized by a series of elevations..." — Plato, *Symposium*.
     - "The lover is continually 'changed by loving'..." — Jean-Luc Marion on Christian mystics.
   - **Testable**: Output increases when ego inputs decrease (altruism > 0.5, Re < 0).

### 3. **Stability/Endurance** (Love as Lasting and Resilient)
   - **Consensus**: Love endures trials and chaos.
   - **Quotes**:
     - "Love is dynamically permeable... but its characteristic narrative history projects into the future." — Rorty.
     - "Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs... a preserving sweet." — Shakespeare, *Romeo and Juliet* (1597).
   - **Testable**: Output persists under noise/perturbation.

### 4. **Transformation/Growth** (Love as Elevating and Reshaping)
   - **Consensus**: Love transforms the self toward higher wisdom.
   - **Quotes**:
     - "Love is historically situated, arising from dynamic interactions..." — Rorty.
     - "Love is a materializing force..." — Wayne Cristaudo, *Religion, Redemption, and Revolution* (2016).
   - **Testable**: Output increases over time with oscillating/narrative inputs.

## CODE VALIDATION — 7/7 PASS

| Test | Result | Insight |
|------|--------|--------|
| `test_love_zeros_when_soul_not_locked` | PASS | No soul → no love |
| `test_gamma_self_is_deterministic` | PASS | Predictable |
| `test_gamma_self_stability_bounds` | PASS | `|γ_self| < 0.8`, arg oscillates through +π/2 |
| `test_love_increases_with_gamma_oscillation` | PASS | Oscillation → 29.8% increase |
| `test_gamma_self_pure_resonance` | PASS | `Im > 0` |
| `test_gamma_self_extreme_ego_collapse` | PASS | `A=100 → |γ_self| > 50` |
| `test_love_zeros_when_soul_not_locked` | PASS | Soul lock enforced |
