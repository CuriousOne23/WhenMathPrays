- Axes : Real = Identity (left: I, right: we); Imaginary = Force (up: union/love, down: repulsion/enmity).

Space definition Angles : 
1. (0,0) Buddhist stillness. 
2. Pi (180°) narcissist - pure ego, no pull. 
3. +π/2 (90°) soulmate zone - no ego, pure draw. 
4. +π/4 (45°) mature marriage - fused but stable, see distribution
5. +π/4 (45°) parent, invested in love, see distribution
6. +3π/4 (135°) ego-dating - want them, but mostly for self.

Distribution shapes about space angle definitions : 
1. Buddhist: tiny symmetric circle. about (0,0) equally distributed
2. Narcissist: horizontal oval, biased on the -Re axis
3. Ego-dating: thin vertical oval (mostly upward), centered, biased on the 135°
4. Mature Marriage: Circle but contained in Q1, center biased along 45°
5. Parent: teardrop - long right, short down, spreading out as gaining magnitude along 45° in Q1
7. (Soldier in the battle field)/divorce: vertical oval, deep down, biased and centered on the -Im line
8. Unhappy marriage: tight circle, low kurtosis, contained in Q3, biased along -3Pi/4 away from center
9. Unhappy Corporate employee: skewed teardrop (narrow going to (0,0)), sudden cliff on hate side, biased and centered on the -135° line
